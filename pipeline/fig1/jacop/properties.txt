JaCoP properties that can be controlled by option -D in java command. For example, java -Dmax_edge_find_size=200 controls the maximal size of the task list in the cumulative constraint to use edge-finding algorithm.


Properties:

Java specific:
==============
- max_edge_find_size: use edge finder in the cumulative constraints if
  it contains less tasks than this number; default 100. This applies
  to Cumulative constraint only, CumulativeUnary uses edge finding
  always.

- sub_circuit_scc_pruning: use pruning method based on strongly
  connected components; default true (one of sub_circuit_* must be true).

- sub_circuit_dominance_pruning: use pruning method based on node
  domination in graphs; default false (one of sub_circuit_* must be true).

flatzinc compiler specific:
===========================
- fz_cumulative_use_unary: during constraints generation in flatzinc
  compiler use CumulativeUnary for tasks that have resource capacity
  greater than half of the cumulative capacity bound; default=false

- fz_cumulative_use_disjunctions: during constraints generation in
  flatzinc compiler pairwaise task disjunction constraints for all
  pairs of tasks that have sum of resource capacities greater than the
  cumulative capacity bound; default=false

- fz_system_timer: if =true use System.nonoTime instead of ManagementFactory
  timer for threads, otherwise use thread time.

= Description of the intent of that setup

The goal of this dataset is to configure a custom directory layout for workspaces and builds.
This for use with @LocalData to test JENKINS-50164

Specifically, the config.xml should contain:

```
<workspaceDir>${JENKINS_HOME}/previous-custom-workspace/${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</workspaceDir>
<buildsDir>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}/ze-previous-custom-builds</buildsDir>
```

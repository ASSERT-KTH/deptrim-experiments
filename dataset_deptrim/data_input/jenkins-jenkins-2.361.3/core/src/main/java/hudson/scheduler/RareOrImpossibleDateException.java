/**
 * This exception is thrown when trying to determine the previous or next occurrence of a given date determines
 * that it's not happened, or going to happen, within some time period (e.g. within the next year).
 *
 * <p>This can typically have a few different reasons:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The date is impossible. For example, June 31 does never happen, so {@code 0 0 31 6 *} will never happen</li>
 *   <li>The date happens only rarely
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>February 29 being the obvious one</li>
 *       <li>Cron tab patterns specifying all of month, day of month, and day of week can also occur so rarely to trigger this exception</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>

 * The thrower will need to hold on to a reference to this instance as a handle to call {@link #completed}.
 * <p>The execution may not extend into another Jenkins session; if you wish to model a long-running execution, you must schedule a new task after restart.
 * This class is not serializable anyway.
 * <p>Mainly intended for use with {@link OneOffExecutor} (from a {@link FlyweightTask}), of which there could be many,
 * but could also be used with a heavyweight executor even though the number of executors is bounded by node configuration.
 * <p>{@link ResourceController}/{@link ResourceActivity}/{@link ResourceList}/{@link Resource} are not currently supported.
 * Nor are {@link hudson.model.Queue.Task#getSubTasks} other than the primary task.

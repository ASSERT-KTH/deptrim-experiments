  Jenkins can record the 'fingerprint' of files (most often jar files) to keep
  track of where/when those files are produced and used. When you have
  inter-dependent projects on Jenkins, this allows you to quickly find out
  answers to questions like:

  <ul>
    <li>
      I have
      <code>foo.jar</code>
      on my HDD but which build number of FOO did it come from?
    </li>
    <li>
      My BAR project depends on
      <code>foo.jar</code>
      from the FOO project.
    </li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Which build of
          <code>foo.jar</code>
          is used in BAR #51?
        </li>
        <li>
          Which build of BAR contains my bug fix to
          <code>foo.jar</code>
          #32?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To use this feature, all of the involved projects (not just the project in
    which a file is produced, but also the projects in which the file is used)
    need to use this and record fingerprints.

  Parameters allow you to prompt users for one or more inputs that will be
  passed into a build. For example, you might have a project that runs tests on
  demand by allowing users to upload a zip file with binaries to be tested. This
  could be done by adding a
  <i>File Parameter</i>
  here.
  <br />
  Or you might have a project that releases some software, and you want users to
  enter release notes that will be uploaded along with the software. This could
  be done by adding a
  <i>Multi-line String Parameter</i>
  here.
  <p>
    Each parameter has a
    <i>Name</i>
    and some sort of
    <i>Value</i>
    , depending on the parameter type. These name-value pairs will be exported
    as environment variables when the build starts, allowing subsequent parts of
    the build configuration (such as build steps) to access those values, e.g.
    by using the
    <code>${PARAMETER_NAME}</code>
    syntax (or
    <code>%PARAMETER_NAME%</code>
    on Windows).
    <br />
    This also implies that each parameter defined here should have a unique
    <i>Name</i>
    .
  </p>

  <p>
    When a project is parameterized, the usual
    <i>Build Now</i>
    link will be replaced with a
    <i>Build with Parameters</i>
    link, where users will be prompted to specify values for each of the defined
    parameters. If they choose not to enter anything, the build will start with
    the default value for each parameter.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a build is started automatically, for example if started by an SCM
    trigger, the default values for each parameter will be used.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a parameterized build is in the queue, attempting to start another
    build of the same project will only succeed if the parameter values are
    different, or if the
    <i>Execute concurrent builds if necessary</i>
    option is enabled.

# We detected that Jenkins does not have sufficient permission to run, \ 
# as indicated by the stack trace below. Most likely cause of this  \ 
# problem is that the security manger is on. If that was intended, \ 
# you need to grant sufficient permissions for Jenkins to run. Otherwise, \ 
# or if you have no idea what a security manager is, then the easiest \ 
# way to fix the problem is simply to turn the security manager off.

de segurança, poderá desativá-lo.
Error=Erro

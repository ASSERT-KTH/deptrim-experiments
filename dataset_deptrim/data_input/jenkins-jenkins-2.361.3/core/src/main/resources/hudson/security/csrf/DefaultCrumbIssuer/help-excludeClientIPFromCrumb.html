  Some HTTP proxies filter out information that the default crumb issuer uses to
  calculate the nonce value. If an HTTP proxy sits between your browser client
  and your Jenkins server and you receive a 403 response when submitting a form
  to Jenkins, checking this option may help. Using this option makes the nonce
  value easier to forge.

  Pass all build variables into maven process in form of java properties. This
  is seldom needed as Jenkins provides it as environment variables anyway.
  Preferred way to access Jenkins build variables is to explicitly map it to
  property in
  <i>Properties</i>
  section (
  <code>MY_VAR=${MY_VAR}</code>
  ).

<div>
  Runs a shell script (defaults to
  <code>sh</code>
  , but this is configurable) for building the project. The script will be run
  with the workspace as the current directory. Type in the contents of your
  shell script. If your shell script has no header line like
  <code>#!/bin/sh</code>
  &mdash;, then the shell configured system-wide will be used, but you can also
  use the header line to write script in another language (like
  <code>#!/bin/perl</code>
  ) or control the options that shell uses.

  <p>
    By default, the shell will be invoked with the "-ex" option. So all of the
    commands are printed before being executed, and the build is considered a
    failure if any of the commands exits with a non-zero exit code. Again, add
    the
    <code>#!/bin/...</code>
    line to change this behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a best practice, try not to put a long shell script in here. Instead,
    consider adding the shell script in SCM and simply call that shell script
    from Jenkins (via
    <code>bash -ex myscript.sh</code>
    or something like that), so that you can track changes in your shell script.

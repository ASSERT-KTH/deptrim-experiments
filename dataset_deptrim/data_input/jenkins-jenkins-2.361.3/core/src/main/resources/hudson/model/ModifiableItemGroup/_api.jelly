    <h2>Create Job</h2>
    <p>
        To create a new job, post <code>config.xml</code> to <a href="../createItem">this URL</a> with
        query parameter <code>name=<i>JOBNAME</i></code>. You need to send a <code>Content-Type: application/xml</code>
        header. You will get a 200 status code if the creation is successful,
        or 4xx/5xx code if it fails. <code>config.xml</code> is the format Jenkins uses to store the project
        in the file system, so you can see examples of them in the Jenkins home directory, or by retrieving
        the XML configuration of existing jobs from <code>/job/<i>JOBNAME</i>/config.xml</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Copy Job</h2>
    <p>
        To copy a job, send a POST request to <a href="../createItem">this URL</a> with
        three query parameters <code>name=<i>NEWJOBNAME</i>&amp;mode=copy&amp;from=<i>FROMJOBNAME</i></code>
    </p>

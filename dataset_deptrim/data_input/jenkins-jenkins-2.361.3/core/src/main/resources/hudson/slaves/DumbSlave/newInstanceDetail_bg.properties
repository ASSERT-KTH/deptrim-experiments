# Adds a plain, permanent agent to Jenkins. This is called "permanent" because Jenkins doesn’t provide \ 
# higher level of integration with these agents, such as dynamic provisioning. \ 
# Select this type if no other agent types apply &mdash; for example such as when you are adding \ 
# a physical computer, virtual machines managed outside Jenkins, etc.
detail=\
 Добавяне на обикновен, постоянен агент към Jenkins. Нарича се „постоянен“,\
 защото Jenkins не предлага по-високи нива на интеграция с този вид агенти,\
 като например динамично заделяне. Изберете този вид агент, само ако другите\
 видове агенти не работят, напр. когато добавяте физически компютър, виртуални\
 машини, които се управляват извън Jenkins, и т.н.

  If set, the batch errorlevel result that will be interpreted as an unstable
  build result. If the final errorlevel matches the value, the build results
  will be set to unstable and next steps will be continued. Supported values
  match the widest errorlevel range for Windows like systems. In Windows NT4 and
  beyond the ERRORLEVEL is stored as a four byte, signed integer, yielding
  maximum and minimum values of 2147483647 and -2147483648, respectively. Older
  versions of Windows use 2 bytes. DOS like systems use single byte, yielding
  errorlevels between 0-255. The value 0 is ignored and does not make the build
  unstable to keep the default behaviour consistent.

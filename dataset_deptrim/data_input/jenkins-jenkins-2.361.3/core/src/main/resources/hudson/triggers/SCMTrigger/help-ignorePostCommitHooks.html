  Ignore changes notified by SCM post-commit hooks.
  <p>
    This can be useful if you want to prevent some long-running jobs (e.g.
    reports) starting because of every commit, but still want to run them
    periodic if SCM changes have occurred.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that this option needs to be supported by the SCM plugin, too! The
    subversion-plugin supports this since version 1.44.

  Choose this option to let Jenkins install this tool for you on demand.

  <p>
    If you check this option, you'll then be asked to configure a series of
    "installer"s for this tool, where each installer defines how Jenkins will
    try to install this tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a platform-independent tool (such as Ant), configuring multiple
    installers for a single tool does not make much sense, but for a platform
    dependent tool, multiple installer configurations allow you to run a
    different set up script depending on the agent environment.

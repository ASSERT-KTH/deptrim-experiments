  Fingerprinter uses Ant
  <code>org.apache.tools.ant.DirectoryScanner</code>
  which by default is case sensitive. For instance, if the job produces *.hpi
  files, pattern "**/*.HPI" will fail to find them.
  <br />
  <br />
  This option can be used to disable case sensitivity. When it's unchecked,
  pattern "**/*.HPI" will match any *.hpi files, or pattern
  "**/cAsEsEnSiTiVe.jar" will match a file called caseSensitive.jar.

  Provides a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cron">cron</a>
  -like feature to periodically execute this project.

  <p>
    This feature is primarily for using Jenkins as a cron replacement, and it is
    <b>not ideal for continuously building software projects</b>
    . When people first start continuous integration, they are often so used to
    the idea of regularly scheduled builds like nightly/weekly that they use
    this feature. However, the point of continuous integration is to start a
    build as soon as a change is made, to provide a quick feedback to the
    change. To do that you need to
    <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/scm-change-trigger">
      hook up SCM change notification to Jenkins
    </a>
    .
  </p>

  <p>
    So, before using this feature, stop and ask yourself if this is really what
    you want.

  Labels (or tags) are used to group multiple agents into one logical group.
  <p>
  For example, if you have multiple Windows agents and you have a job that
  must run on Windows, then you could configure all your Windows agents to have
  the label <code>windows</code>, and then tie that job to this label.
  <br>
  This would ensure that your job runs on one of your Windows agents, but not on
  any agents without this label.
  <p>
  Labels do not necessarily have to represent the operating system on the agent;
  you can also use labels to note the CPU architecture, or that a certain tool
  is installed on the agent.
  <p>
  Multiple labels must be separated by a space. For example,
  <code>windows docker</code> would assign two labels to the agent: <code>windows</code>
  and <code>docker</code>.
  <p>
  Labels may contain any non-space characters, but you should avoid special
  characters such as any of these: <code>!&amp;|&lt;&gt;()</code>, as other Jenkins
  features allow for defining label expressions, where these characters may be
  used.

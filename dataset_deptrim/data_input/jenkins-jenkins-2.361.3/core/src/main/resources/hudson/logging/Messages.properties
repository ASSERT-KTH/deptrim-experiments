LogRecorderManager.init=Initializing log recorders
LogRecorderManager.DisplayName=System Log
LogRecorderManager.LoggerNotFound=A logger named "{0}" does not exist. \
  Add a logger by this name to a log recorder before attempting to configure its level.
LogRecorder.Target.Empty.Warning=Setting the Root (empty) logger to FINE or below is strongly discouraged \
  as it excessively hurts performances. It may well crash Jenkins and prevent it to start.

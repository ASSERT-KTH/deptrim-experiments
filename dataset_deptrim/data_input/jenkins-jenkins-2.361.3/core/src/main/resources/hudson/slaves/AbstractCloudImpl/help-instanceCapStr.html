  You can place the upward limit to the number of agents that Jenkins may launch
  from this cloud. This is useful for avoiding surprises in the billing
  statement.

  <p>
    For example, if this field is 3, Jenkins will only launch a new instance as
    long as total number of instances you run on this cloud doesn't exceed this
    number. In this way, even in the worst case of Jenkins starting instances
    and forgetting about them, you have an upper bound in the number of
    instances that are concurrently executed.

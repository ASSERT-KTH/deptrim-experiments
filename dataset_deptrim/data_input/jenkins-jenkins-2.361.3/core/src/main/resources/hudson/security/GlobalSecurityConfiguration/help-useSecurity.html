    Enabling security allows configuring authentication (how people can identify
    themselves) and authorization (what permissions they get).
  </p>

  <p>
    A number of options are built in. Please note that granting significant
    permissions to anonymous users, or allowing users to sign up and granting
    permissions to all authenticated users, does not actually increase security.

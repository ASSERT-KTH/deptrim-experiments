    Invisible &lt;f:entry> type for embedding a descriptor's $class field.

    Most of the time a Descriptor has an unique class name that we can use to instantiate the right Describable
    class, so we use the '$class' to represent that to clarify the intent.
    
    In some other times, such as templates, there are multiple Descriptors with the same Descriptor.clazz
    but different IDs, and in that case we put 'kind' to indicate that. In this case, to avoid confusing
    readers we do not put non-unique '$class'.

    See Descriptor.newInstancesFromHeteroList for how the reader side is handled.

    <st:attribute name="clazz">
      The describable class that we are instantiating via structured form submission.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="descriptor">
      The descriptor of the describable that we are instantiating via
      structured form submission.  Mutually exclusive with clazz.
    </st:attribute>

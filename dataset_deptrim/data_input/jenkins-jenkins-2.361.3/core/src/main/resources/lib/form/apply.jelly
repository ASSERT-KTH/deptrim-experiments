    "Apply" button that submits the form but without a page transition.
    See hudson.util.FormApply for the server-side code.

    When this button is pressed, the FORM element fires the "jenkins:apply" event
    that allows interested parties to write back whatever states back into the INPUT
    elements.
    <s:attribute name="value">
      The text of the apply button.

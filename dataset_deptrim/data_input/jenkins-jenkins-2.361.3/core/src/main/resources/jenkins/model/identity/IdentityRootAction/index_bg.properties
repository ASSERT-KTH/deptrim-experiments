# Every Jenkins instance has a pair of public and private keys used to uniquely identify that Jenkins instance. \ 
# The public key is published in the <code>X-Instance-Identity</code> header for web requests against the Jenkins UI. \ 
# You can also find the key and the fingerprint of the key on this page.
blurb=\
 Всяка инсталация на Jenkins има двойка публичен и частен ключ, които са\
 уникални и служат за идентификация. Публичният ключ се извежда в заглавната\
 част <code>X-Instance-Identity</code> на отговора към всяка заявка към уеб\
 интерфейса на Jenkins. Ключът и неговият отпечатък са дадени и на текущата уеб\
 страница.

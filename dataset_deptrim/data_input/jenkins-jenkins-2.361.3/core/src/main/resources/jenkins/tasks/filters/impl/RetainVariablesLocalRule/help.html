  <p>Limit which environment variables are passed to a build step.</p>

  <p>
    Environment variables passed to the build step are filtered, unless listed
    below.
  </p>

  <p>
    The behavior of this filter depends on whether the environment variable is
    originally defined outside Jenkins:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the environment variable originates from Jenkins configuration, such as
      <code>JOB_URL</code>
      , it will not be passed to the build step unless specified here.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the environment variable originates from outside Jenkins, such as
      <code>PATH</code>
      , the behavior depends on the option
      <em>Process environment variables handling</em>
      : If that option is set to
      <em>Retain</em>
      , the original value will be passed to the build step, discarding any
      modifications inside Jenkins. If that option is set to
      <em>Remove</em>
      , the variable will not be passed to the build step.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following table shows the effect of filtering on an environment
    variable:

  <table width="100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Behavior</th>
      <th>Originally defined outside Jenkins</th>
      <th>Originally defined inside Jenkins</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <em>Process environment variables handling:</em>
        reset
      </th>
      <td>Variable is reset to original value</td>
      <td>Variable is removed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <em>Process environment variables handling:</em>
        removed
      </th>
      <td>Variable is removed</td>
      <td>Variable is removed</td>

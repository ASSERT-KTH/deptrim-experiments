  <p>
    Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new
    build is scheduled for this project. This is convenient for running an
    extensive test after a build is complete, for example.
  </p>
  <p>
    This configuration complements the "Build other projects" section in the
    "Post-build Actions" of an upstream project, but is preferable when you want
    to configure the downstream project.

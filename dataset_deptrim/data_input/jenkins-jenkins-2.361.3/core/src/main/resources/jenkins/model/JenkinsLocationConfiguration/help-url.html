<div>
  Optionally specify the HTTP address of the Jenkins installation, such as
  <code>http://yourhost.yourdomain/jenkins/</code>
  . This value is used to let Jenkins know how to refer to itself, ie. to
  display images or to create links in emails.

  <p>
    This is necessary because Jenkins cannot reliably detect such a URL from
    within itself.

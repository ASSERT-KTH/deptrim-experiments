  If this option is enabled, then the date of the most recent use of each API
  token and the total number of times it has been used are stored in Jenkins.
  This allows users to see if they have unused or outdated API tokens which
  should be revoked.

  This data is stored in your Jenkins instance and will not be used for any
  other purpose.

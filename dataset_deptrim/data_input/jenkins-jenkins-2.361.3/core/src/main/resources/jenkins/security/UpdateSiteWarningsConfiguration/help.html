<p>
  This list contains all warnings relevant to currently installed components
  published by the configured update sites. These are typically
  security-related. Warnings that have been published but are not relevant to
  currently installed components (either because the affected component isn't
  installed, or an unaffected version is installed) are not shown here.
</p>
<p>
  Checked entries (the default) are
  <em>active</em>
  , i.e. they're shown to administrators in an administrative monitor. Entries
  can be unchecked to hide them. This can be useful if you've evaluated a
  specific warning and are confident it does not apply to your environment or
  configuration, and continued use of the specified component does not
  constitute a security problem.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that only specific warnings can be disabled; it is not possible to
  disable all warnings about a certain component. If you wish to disable the
  display of warnings entirely, then you can disable the administrative monitor
  in
  <em>Configure System</em>
  .

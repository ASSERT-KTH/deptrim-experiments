  API tokens offer a way to make authenticated CLI or REST API calls. See
  <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/api-token">our wiki</a>
  for more details.
  <br />
  The username associated with each token is your Jenkins username.
  <br />
  <br />
  Some good practices for keeping your API tokens secure are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use a different token for each application so that if an application is
      compromised you can revoke its token individually.
    </li>
    <li>
      Regenerate the tokens every 6 months (depending on your context). We
      display an indicator concerning the age of the token.
    </li>
    <li>
      Protect it like your password, as it allows other people to access Jenkins
      as you.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="warning">
    Every time Jenkins is restarted the creation dates for unused legacy tokens
    are reset which means that the dates may be inaccurate.

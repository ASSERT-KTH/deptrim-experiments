Title=什麼是「專案關聯」?
body=如果您的專案間彼此有關聯，Jenkins 就能追蹤下游專案到底是使用到上游專案的哪一版進行建置。這個功能是利用<a href\="https\://www.jenkins.io/redirect/fingerprint">檔案指紋功能</a>所產生的記錄來達成。
For\ this\ feature\ to\ work,\ the\ following\ conditions\ need\ to\ be\ met\:=符合下列條件才能使用這個功能\:
The\ upstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ its\ build\ artifacts.=上游專案要記錄建置成品的指紋。
The\ downstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ the\ upstream\ files\ it\ uses.=下游專案要記錄用到的上游檔案指紋。
This\ allows\ Jenkins\ to\ correlate\ two\ projects.=如此一來 Jenkins 就能關聯這兩個專案。
